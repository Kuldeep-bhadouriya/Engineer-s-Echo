Follow these steps to run the project locally.

1. Clone the repo

   git clone <repo-url>

2. Install dependencies (run separately for frontend and backend if split)

   npm install

3. Create a `.env` file at the project root (or specified folders) with required secrets:

   - MONGODB_URI - your MongoDB connection string
   - JWT_SECRET - secret for signing JWTs
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL - (frontend) backend API base URL
   - MAIL_HOST / MAIL_USER / MAIL_PASS - (optional) mail settings for newsletters

4. Run the development server

   npm run dev

   The app should be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Deployment

- Frontend: Deploy to Vercel or Netlify (Next.js optimized support on Vercel).
- Backend: Containerize with Docker (optional) or deploy to your preferred Node hosting (Heroku, Render, DigitalOcean App Platform, etc.).
- CI/CD: Configure GitHub Actions workflows for test, build, and deployment steps.

## API and Extensibility

The project exposes RESTful APIs (and can be extended to GraphQL). Follow the docs in the `docs/` folder (or `api/` folder) to view endpoints, authentication flows, and request/response shapes. Endpoints are modular and designed for easy extension.
